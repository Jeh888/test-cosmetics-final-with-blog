## What is Botox and How Does It Work?

Botox, or botulinum toxin, is a purified protein that temporarily relaxes facial muscles responsible for creating wrinkles. When injected by a qualified practitioner, it smooths out lines and prevents new ones from forming.

The treatment has been safely used for cosmetic purposes for over 20 years and remains the world's most popular non-surgical aesthetic treatment. In London alone, thousands of Botox treatments are performed every week.

## Common Treatment Areas

**Forehead Lines**
Horizontal lines that appear when you raise your eyebrows. Typically requires 10-20 units.

**Frown Lines (Glabellar Lines)**
The "eleven" lines between your eyebrows. Usually needs 15-25 units.

**Crow's Feet**
Fine lines around the eyes that appear when smiling. Generally 8-15 units per side.

**Other Areas**
Botox can also treat bunny lines on the nose, lip flip for a subtle pout, jawline slimming, and excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).

## How Much Does Botox Cost in London?

London Botox prices vary significantly:

- **Harley Street clinics**: £300-500 per area
- **Premium high street clinics**: £200-350 per area
- **Standard clinics**: £150-250 per area

Most patients treat 2-3 areas, making the typical total £300-600 per session.

## Choosing a Practitioner

When selecting a Botox provider in London, consider:

1. **Qualifications**: Look for medical professionals (doctors, dentists, nurses) with specific aesthetic training
2. **Experience**: Ask how many treatments they perform monthly
3. **Reviews**: Check Google reviews and before/after photos
4. **Consultation**: A good practitioner will offer a thorough consultation before treatment
5. **Products**: Ensure they use genuine Botox, Bocouture, or Azzalure

## What to Expect During Treatment

A typical Botox appointment takes 15-30 minutes:

1. **Consultation**: Discussion of your concerns and goals
2. **Assessment**: Facial analysis to determine injection points
3. **Preparation**: Skin cleansing
4. **Injection**: Small amounts injected with fine needles
5. **Aftercare**: Instructions for the next 24 hours

Most patients describe the sensation as a small pinch. No anaesthesia is required.

## Results and Longevity

- **Initial effects**: Visible within 3-5 days
- **Full results**: 10-14 days
- **Duration**: 3-4 months typically
- **Maintenance**: Regular treatments every 3-4 months

With consistent treatment, many patients find their results last longer over time as muscles become trained to relax.

## Aftercare Tips

For the first 24 hours after Botox:

- Stay upright for 4 hours
- Avoid touching or rubbing treated areas
- Skip intense exercise
- Avoid alcohol
- Don't lie face down

## Is Botox Right for You?

Botox is ideal if you want to:
- Soften existing wrinkles
- Prevent new lines from forming
- Achieve a refreshed, natural look
- Enjoy results without surgery or downtime

It's not suitable during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or for those with certain neuromuscular conditions.
