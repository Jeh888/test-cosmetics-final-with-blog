## Understanding Why We Age

Before exploring the treatments that can turn back the clock, it's worth understanding what happens to our faces as we age. This knowledge helps you choose treatments that address your specific concerns rather than following trends that may not suit your needs.

From our mid-twenties onwards, our skin begins to lose collagen at a rate of approximately one percent per year. Collagen is the protein that gives skin its firmness and structure, so this gradual loss leads to sagging, fine lines, and a loss of the youthful plumpness we once took for granted. By the time we reach fifty, we may have lost nearly half of our skin's original collagen content.

Elastin, another crucial protein that gives skin its ability to snap back after being stretched, also diminishes with age. This loss contributes to the development of wrinkles and the gradual descent of facial features. The fat pads that give young faces their smooth, full appearance begin to shrink and shift downward, creating hollows under the eyes, flattened cheeks, and jowls along the jawline.

Even our facial bones change, with the eye sockets enlarging and the jaw shrinking. This bone resorption removes the scaffolding that supports our facial soft tissues, accelerating the visible signs of ageing. Understanding these multiple factors helps explain why a comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation often works better than addressing just one concern.

## Botox and Anti-Wrinkle Injections

[Botox](/botox) remains the gold standard treatment for dynamic wrinkles, those lines that appear when you make facial expressions. After more than two decades of cosmetic use, it has an unparalleled safety record and consistently delivers predictable results when administered by skilled practitioners.

The treatment works by temporarily relaxing the muscles responsible for creating expression lines. When these muscles are prevented from contracting fully, the overlying skin smooths out and new lines are prevented from forming. The most commonly treated areas are the forehead, the frown lines between the eyebrows, and the crow's feet around the eyes, though Botox has numerous other applications.

What makes Botox particularly appealing is its simplicity and convenience. Treatment takes only fifteen to thirty minutes, there's no recovery time required, and results last three to four months. Many people incorporate regular Botox into their maintenance routine, treating themselves every few months to maintain smooth, youthful skin.

The preventative use of Botox has become increasingly popular among younger patients. By starting treatment before deep lines become established, these patients may be able to prevent wrinkles from ever forming. Some research suggests that long-term Botox users develop weaker facial muscles over time, potentially extending the intervals between treatments.

## The Power of Dermal Fillers

While Botox addresses muscle-driven wrinkles, [dermal fillers](/dermal-fillers) tackle a different aspect of ageing: volume loss. Made primarily from hyaluronic acid, a substance naturally found in our skin, these injectable gels can restore lost volume, smooth deep creases, and reshape facial contours.

The cheeks are one of the most transformative areas for filler treatment. Restoring volume to the mid-face with [cheek fillers](/cheek-fillers) can lift the entire lower face, softening nasolabial folds and reducing the appearance of jowls without directly treating those areas. This lifting effect demonstrates how addressing volume loss at its source can have far-reaching benefits.

[Lip fillers](/lip-fillers) have become one of the most popular aesthetic treatments worldwide, and not just among young people seeking fuller pouts. As we age, our lips lose volume and definition, and the fine vertical lines around the mouth become more pronounced. Subtle lip enhancement can restore a youthful shape while hydrating and smoothing the lip tissue.

[Jawline fillers](/jawline-fillers) and chin augmentation have gained popularity as people recognise the importance of lower face structure in overall facial harmony. A well-defined jawline creates a more youthful profile and can even make the face appear slimmer. These treatments demonstrate how fillers have evolved beyond simple wrinkle filling to become tools for comprehensive facial sculpting.

## Profhilo: The Skin Quality Revolution

[Profhilo](/profhilo) represents a different approach to injectable treatments, focusing on improving overall skin quality rather than adding volume or relaxing muscles. This innovative treatment delivers high concentrations of hyaluronic acid to stimulate collagen and elastin production, resulting in firmer, more hydrated, more radiant skin.

Unlike traditional fillers, Profhilo spreads beneath the skin to treat larger areas with fewer injection points. The treatment is typically administered in a specific pattern of five points on each side of the face, taking advantage of the product's ability to disperse evenly through the tissue. This makes treatment quick and relatively comfortable.

Results from Profhilo develop gradually over several weeks as your skin responds to the treatment by producing new collagen and elastin. Most people require two sessions, spaced four weeks apart, to achieve optimal results. The improvement in skin quality can last six months or longer, with many patients choosing to maintain their results with periodic top-up treatments.

Profhilo is particularly effective for addressing skin laxity and crepiness on the face, neck, and hands. It works beautifully as a standalone treatment or in combination with other procedures. Many practitioners now recommend Profhilo as a foundational treatment to improve skin quality before addressing specific concerns with Botox or fillers.

## Microneedling for Skin Renewal

[Microneedling](/microneedling) harnesses the skin's natural healing response to stimulate collagen production and improve skin texture. The treatment uses a device covered in tiny needles to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin, triggering a healing cascade that results in newer, healthier tissue.

The beauty of microneedling lies in its versatility. It can improve fine lines and wrinkles, reduce the appearance of scars including acne scarring, minimise enlarged pores, even out skin tone, and enhance the penetration of skincare products. The treatment can be adjusted in intensity to suit different skin types and concerns.

Most people experience some redness after microneedling, similar to mild sunburn, which typically resolves within a day or two. Results develop progressively over several weeks as new collagen forms, with optimal improvement usually seen after a series of three to six treatments spaced four to six weeks apart.

When combined with platelet-rich plasma, known as a PRP facial or vampire facial, microneedling becomes even more powerful. The growth factors in PRP amplify the skin's healing response, potentially accelerating and enhancing results. This combination treatment has become increasingly popular for comprehensive skin rejuvenation.

## Chemical Peels: Proven and Effective

[Chemical peels](/chemical-peels) have been used for skin rejuvenation for decades, and modern formulations have made them safer, more comfortable, and more effective than ever. These treatments use carefully selected acids to remove damaged outer layers of skin, revealing fresher, smoother, more evenly toned skin beneath.

The intensity of chemical peels ranges from superficial peels that cause minimal downtime to deep peels that require significant recovery but deliver dramatic results. Superficial peels using ingredients like glycolic acid or lactic acid can brighten the complexion and improve texture with no more than mild flaking for a day or two.

Medium-depth peels, often using trichloroacetic acid, penetrate deeper to address more significant concerns like moderate sun damage, deeper wrinkles, and stubborn pigmentation. These treatments typically involve several days of visible peeling and require careful sun protection during recovery. The results, however, can be impressive and long-lasting.

For many people, a series of lighter peels provides excellent results with minimal disruption to daily life. Your practitioner can recommend the most appropriate type and strength of peel based on your skin type, concerns, and lifestyle. Regular maintenance peels can help sustain results and continue improving skin quality over time.

## Building Your Personal Anti-Ageing Strategy

The most effective approach to anti-ageing combines multiple treatments strategically, addressing different aspects of facial ageing in a coordinated way. Rather than trying everything at once, work with a skilled practitioner to develop a personalised plan that evolves with your needs.

In your thirties, the focus is typically on prevention and maintenance. Regular Botox can prevent expression lines from becoming permanent, while good skincare and occasional treatments like peels or microneedling maintain skin quality. This is also an excellent time to establish a relationship with a practitioner who can guide your aesthetic journey over the coming years.

During your forties, you may notice volume loss becoming more apparent. This is when many people add dermal fillers to their treatment repertoire, restoring youthful contours to the cheeks, softening nasolabial folds, or enhancing lip definition. Skin quality treatments like Profhilo can address early laxity and maintain that healthy glow.

From your fifties onwards, a more comprehensive approach often yields the best results. Combining Botox, strategically placed fillers, and skin-quality treatments can achieve a natural-looking rejuvenation that addresses all the factors contributing to an aged appearance. The key is maintaining balance and avoiding over-treatment that can look artificial.

## Choosing Quality Over Price

When it comes to anti-ageing treatments, the skill of your practitioner matters enormously. A talented, experienced injector will create natural-looking results that enhance your appearance without making you look "done." An inexperienced or heavy-handed practitioner can leave you looking frozen, overfilled, or simply strange.

Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true. While it's natural to seek value, dramatically discounted aesthetic treatments often indicate inexperienced practitioners, inferior products, or high-pressure sales environments. The cost of correcting a bad outcome almost always exceeds what you would have spent on quality treatment initially.

Take your time when choosing a practitioner. Request consultations with several providers, ask to see before and after photos of their work, and pay attention to how they listen to your concerns. The best practitioners will never pressure you, will set realistic expectations, and will sometimes recommend against treatments they don't think will benefit you.
