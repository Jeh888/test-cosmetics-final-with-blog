## The Science of Skin Ageing

Before exploring treatments, it helps to understand what causes visible ageing:

- **Collagen loss**: We lose about 1% of collagen per year from our mid-20s
- **Elastin breakdown**: Skin loses its snap-back quality
- **Fat redistribution**: Volume shifts downward over time
- **Bone resorption**: Facial bones shrink, reducing structural support
- **Muscle changes**: Some muscles weaken while others become overactive

Effective anti-ageing treatments target one or more of these factors.

## Top Anti-Ageing Treatments for 2025

### 1. Botox and Anti-Wrinkle Injections

**Best for**: Dynamic wrinkles (forehead, frown lines, crow's feet)
**How it works**: Relaxes muscles that cause expression lines
**Results**: 3-4 months
**Price range**: £150-350 per area

Botox remains the gold standard for treating movement-related wrinkles. It's also increasingly popular as a preventative treatment for those in their late 20s and 30s.

### 2. Dermal Fillers

**Best for**: Volume loss, deep lines, facial contouring
**How it works**: Hyaluronic acid adds volume and stimulates collagen
**Results**: 9-18 months depending on area
**Price range**: £250-600 per syringe

Strategic filler placement can restore youthful contours to cheeks, jawline, and under-eyes while softening deep folds.

### 3. Profhilo

**Best for**: Overall skin quality, fine lines, crepey skin
**How it works**: High-concentration hyaluronic acid stimulates collagen and elastin
**Results**: 6+ months with 2 sessions
**Price range**: £300-450 per session

Profhilo has revolutionised skin rejuvenation by improving skin quality from within rather than adding volume.

### 4. Polynucleotides

**Best for**: Skin regeneration, texture, under-eyes
**How it works**: DNA fragments stimulate fibroblast activity and tissue repair
**Results**: 6-12 months
**Price range**: £250-450 per session

The newest breakthrough in regenerative aesthetics, polynucleotides offer genuine skin regeneration rather than just temporary improvement.

### 5. Microneedling

**Best for**: Texture, scars, fine lines, pores
**How it works**: Controlled micro-injuries trigger collagen production
**Results**: Cumulative over 3-6 sessions
**Price range**: £150-400 per session

When combined with growth factors or PRP, microneedling delivers impressive skin renewal.

### 6. Chemical Peels

**Best for**: Pigmentation, texture, dullness, fine lines
**How it works**: Controlled exfoliation reveals fresh skin
**Results**: Progressive over multiple treatments
**Price range**: £80-350 per treatment

From gentle lunchtime peels to deeper resurfacing, chemical peels remain highly effective for skin renewal.

### 7. RF Skin Tightening

**Best for**: Mild skin laxity, jawline definition
**How it works**: Radiofrequency energy stimulates collagen contraction
**Results**: Progressive over 2-6 months
**Price range**: £200-500 per session

Non-invasive skin tightening has improved significantly, offering real results without surgery.

## Building an Anti-Ageing Treatment Plan

The most effective approach combines treatments strategically:

### In Your 30s
- **Focus**: Prevention
- **Treatments**: Botox for prevention, good skincare, occasional peels
- **Budget**: £500-1,500/year

### In Your 40s
- **Focus**: Maintenance and early correction
- **Treatments**: Regular Botox, Profhilo, light fillers
- **Budget**: £1,500-3,000/year

### In Your 50s+
- **Focus**: Restoration
- **Treatments**: Combination approach - Botox, fillers, skin treatments
- **Budget**: £2,500-5,000/year

## What Doesn't Work

Be wary of:
- **Miracle creams**: Topicals can help but won't match professional treatments
- **One-size-fits-all approaches**: Effective treatment is personalised
- **Extreme discounts**: Quality practitioners don't drastically undercut market rates
- **Unqualified providers**: Always check credentials

## Choosing a Practitioner

For anti-ageing treatments, experience matters enormously. Look for:

1. Medical background (doctor, nurse, dentist)
2. Specific aesthetic training and qualifications
3. Before and after photos showing natural results
4. Thorough consultation process
5. Willingness to say no when treatments aren't appropriate

## Getting Started

The best first step is a consultation with a qualified practitioner who can assess your specific concerns and recommend appropriate treatments.
