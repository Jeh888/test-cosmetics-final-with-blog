## The First 24 Hours After Lip Fillers

The first day after lip filler treatment is crucial for achieving optimal results. Your lips will be swollen - this is completely normal and not representative of your final results.

### Immediate Aftercare

**What to avoid:**
- Hot drinks and food for 24 hours
- Kissing or applying pressure to lips
- Makeup on or around the lips
- Strenuous exercise
- Alcohol consumption
- Blood-thinning medications (unless prescribed)

**What to do:**
- Apply ice wrapped in cloth for 10 minutes at a time
- Keep your head elevated, even when sleeping
- Stay hydrated with cool water
- Take arnica supplements to reduce bruising

## Managing Swelling

Swelling peaks at 24-48 hours and gradually subsides over 1-2 weeks. Here's what to expect:

**Day 1-2**: Maximum swelling - lips may look significantly larger than intended
**Day 3-5**: Swelling begins to reduce noticeably
**Day 7-10**: Most swelling resolved
**Day 14**: Final results visible

### Tips to Reduce Swelling

1. **Cold compresses**: Apply for 10 minutes every hour while awake
2. **Sleep elevated**: Use an extra pillow for the first few nights
3. **Avoid salt**: Sodium increases water retention
4. **Stay cool**: Avoid hot showers, saunas, and steam rooms

## Dealing with Bruising

Bruising is common but not inevitable. If you do bruise:

- Arnica gel or tablets can help
- Vitamin K cream may speed healing
- Bruising typically resolves within 7-10 days
- Mineral makeup can camouflage bruising after 24 hours

### Minimising Bruise Risk

Before your appointment:
- Avoid alcohol for 24 hours
- Stop fish oil supplements for a week
- Avoid aspirin and ibuprofen if possible
- Consider taking arnica beforehand

## Week One Recovery Timeline

**Day 1**: Significant swelling, possible bruising, tenderness
**Day 2**: Peak swelling, may feel lumpy (normal)
**Day 3**: Swelling beginning to reduce
**Day 4-5**: Noticeable improvement, less tenderness
**Day 6-7**: Looking more natural, minimal swelling remains

## What's Normal vs. When to Worry

### Normal experiences:
- Swelling and bruising
- Tenderness when touching lips
- Small lumps (these usually settle)
- Asymmetry during swelling phase
- Itching as healing occurs

### Contact your practitioner if:
- Severe pain that worsens over time
- White patches or blanching
- Excessive swelling that doesn't improve
- Signs of infection (heat, spreading redness, pus)
- Difficulty opening mouth

## Long-Term Lip Filler Care

Once healed, your lip fillers require minimal maintenance:

### Hydration
Keep lips moisturised with a good lip balm. Hyaluronic acid lip products complement your filler.

### Sun Protection
UV exposure can break down filler faster. Use SPF lip balm daily.

### Maintenance Appointments
Most lip fillers last 6-12 months. Book your top-up before filler completely dissolves for consistent results.

## Getting the Best Results

The final outcome depends on both the practitioner's skill and your aftercare. Following these guidelines gives your lips the best chance of healing beautifully.
